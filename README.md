# 📂 My Project Collection

Welcome to my repo! This is a collection of small to intermediate programs that I’ve built—simple, fun, and useful projects all in one place. Instead of having them scattered across different repos, I decided to lump them all together here. 🚀

## 💡 What's Inside?
You'll find a variety of scripts, mini-apps, and tools covering different programming concepts. Some are just for fun, while others might be helpful utilities.

- 🛠 **Easy-to-make programs** – Simple, beginner-friendly scripts.
- 📈 **Intermediate-level projects** – More structured, slightly complex applications.
- 🎭 **Experimental ideas** – Things I played around with that could inspire new projects.
- 🌐 **Multiple languages** – Different projects use different programming languages, so there’s something for everyone.

## 🔓 Free to Use & Learn From
Everything here is **public and free**. If you see something cool, feel free to:

✅ Use it in your own projects.  
✅ Modify and improve it.  
✅ Get inspired to create something new.  

No strings attached—just give credit if you feel like it! 🙌
